Excited to share my Front-End EMS Project 

 
Built a technology-driven system to monitor election data, promote transparency, and educate first-time voters. The project focuses on reducing misinformation and encouraging informed, responsible participation in the democratic process through clear data presentation.
Our goal: make voting easy, informative, and inspiring for first-time voters, and help build a culture of informed civic participation.
